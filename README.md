# ihQuake - M1 Project



## Description

As far as I remember, **Quake** was the very first competitive computer video game I ever saw and it completely blew my mind. More than two decades after, it is still a superior game having a strong community all around the world. A game that revolutionized the gaming industry for ever.

**ihQuake** is a project developed for the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) Web Development Bootcamp, using RAWG API.



## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

The MVP will include:

- **Homepage:** it will include the classic video game menu as part of the navigation for the app, a welcome message when the user logs in and the credits.
- **Dashboard:** It will include all the video game information provided by the API as well as a navigation pop up to access all pages.
- **Sign Up:** Includes a registration form for new users with email and password validation.
- **Log In:** Includes a form for new users to log in with their previously registered email and password.
- **FAQ:** Additional information about the project.
