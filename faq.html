          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <h3>How to play Quake nowadays?</h3>
          <p>Technically you can play without a source port, but I would consider source 
            ports the ESSENTIAL experience for playing Quake nowadays.
            Mark V is my personal favorite, but Quakespasm is what most people use.
            Both ports are super similar, and most custom maps work with both, so either choice is valid.</p>
          <h3>Best Quake Mod</h3>
          <p>The crown jewel of modern Quake mods is Arcane Dimensions, a massive collaborative dev-jam combining 
            the talents of the best and brightest Quake community's mappers and modders. It's the biggest mod 
            (in terms of megabyte tonnage) in Quake history, weighing in at a staggering 210mb zipped.</p>
          <h3>How to play Quake Online?</h3>
          <p>With QuakeWorld, an official Multiplayer source port made by id Software for Quake that was released in December of 1996. 
              In QW there are three different armor types coloured green, yellow and red. They all give different amounts of armor and of 
              different quality, with red being the best one and green the worst. Probably the most famous feature of QuakeWorld is bunny jumping, 
              but its possible to play QuakeWorld without utilizing that one particular skill.</p>
          <h3>How is the competition format?</h3>
          <p>The most common play style in QuakeWorld, like in all other Quake games, is duel. 
            Your normal duel in Quakeworld is played with a 10 minute limit, spawn health is set to 100, 
            weapons don't respawn and they can only be picked up once. If the score is equal at the end there is 3 minute overtime. 
            The popular duel maps are dm4, dm6, aerowalk, ztndm3 and dm2.</p>
